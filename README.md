# Java Email Sender Project
This Java project allows you to send emails from your local machine to multiple email addresses. It can be used in various industries where email communication is essential, such as marketing, sales, and customer support.

# Main Steps
* Step 1: Connect to an Email Server

To send emails from your local machine, you need to connect to an email server. You can use a service provider like Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook. You will need to provide the following information to connect to the email server:

Hostname - the address of the email server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)

Port number - the port number used by the email server (e.g., 465 for SSL or 587 for TLS)

Username - your email address

Password - your email password

* Step 2: Create a Session

To establish a connection with the email server, you need to create a session. You can create a session using the javax.mail.Session class. You will need to set the

properties of the session object, such as the SMTP host, port number, authentication, and encryption settings.


* Step 3: Compose an Email

To compose an email, you need to create a javax.mail.Message object. You can set the sender, recipients, subject, and body of the email using the setFrom(),

setRecipients(), setSubject(), and setText() methods.


* Step 4: Send the Email

To send the email, you need to call the Transport.send() method and pass in the Message object.
